# TwitchAdOverlay
Displays an overlay whenever a twitch ad is about to play. For use as an alternative to having to download and run Streamer.bot

This code originally came from a widget made by [nutty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5B7ZNGtkac). While this code supports the old method of just using Streamer.bot via StreamElements, it can also be ran locally within OBS.

## Setup

This will be going over how to run the system locally rather than via StreamElements and Streamer.bot.

1. Create a new application via [Twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console). This will give you a client id that you will use later.
2. [Generate an OAuth token](https://twitchapps.com/tokengen/) for your new client id. You will need the following scopes: `channel:edit:commercial channel_commercial channel_read`
  **NOTE:** Make sure your redirect URL is properly set on the developer console.
4. Grant your new application a sign-in to your account.
5. Open `config_example.js` and modify the settings to your desired preferences.
6. Set the value for `twitchOAuthToken` to the new OAuth token that was generated by the tokengen website earlier.
7. Get the numeric channel id for your account by going to [this website](https://streamscharts.com/tools/convert-username).
8. Take the resulting number and use it for the value of `twitchUserID`. This is incredibly important. Without this ID, you will not be able to get advertisement alerts.
9. Save the changes as `config.js`
10. Create a new browser scene in OBS, paste the URL to your html file.
11. You will now get ad overlays and a notification ding (remember to have your browser source also control audio through OBS and monitor that sound channel) whenever you get ads playing on your channel.
